# Anti-Entropic Principle (AEP) Framework

A unified computational framework implementing the Anti-Entropic Principle for consciousness, quantum foundations, and cosmology.

## Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of the Anti-Entropic Principle (AEP) framework, which provides unified solutions to:

- **The Hard Problem of Consciousness** through optimal neural compression
- **The Quantum Measurement Problem** through descriptive efficiency transitions  
- **The Cosmological Constant Problem** through complexity minimization

## Key Features

- **Neural Compression Analysis**: Six computable metrics for consciousness detection
- **Quantum Context Simulation**: Context-dependent wavefunction collapse modeling
- **Cosmological Parameter Fitting**: AEP-constrained cosmological model fitting
- **Cross-Domain Validation**: Unified testing across neuroscience, quantum physics, and cosmology

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scottdevine01-glitch/aep_consciousness.git
cd aep_consciousness
pip install -r requirements.txt
