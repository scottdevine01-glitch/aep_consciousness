# Anti-Entropic Principle (AEP): A Unified Framework

This repository contains the official implementation and resources for the paper:

**"The Anti-Entropic Principle: Unified Solutions to Consciousness, Quantum Foundations, and Cosmological Problems"**

by Scott Devine

## Overview

The Anti-Entropic Principle (AEP) posits that physical laws minimize total descriptive complexity \(K(T)+K(E|T)\). This framework provides unified solutions to:
- The Hard Problem of Consciousness
- The Quantum Measurement Problem
- The Cosmological Constant Problem

This repository provides code for replicating the results and testing the predictions outlined in the paper.

## Contents

- `/neural_compression` - Code for calculating neural complexity metrics (Intrinsic Dimensionality, Predictive Complexity, Φ, etc.)
- `/quantum_simulations` - Simulations for context-dependent quantum measurement and collapse thresholds.
- `/cosmological_models` - Code for cosmological parameter optimization and predictions (e.g., \(f_{NL}^{\text{equil}}\), tensor-to-scalar ratio \(r\)).
- `/data_analysis` - Pipelines for statistical analysis and figure generation.

## Installation & Usage

[Describe how to install dependencies and run the code here. For example:]
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/aep_consciousness.git`
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run a specific module...

## Predictions & Experimental Validation

This framework makes testable predictions in:
- **Neuroscience:** Specific neural compression signatures during conscious states (see `neural_compression/`)
- **Quantum Foundations:** Context-dependent collapse (see `quantum_simulations/`)
- **Cosmology:** Specific values for \(f_{NL}^{\text{equil}} = -0.416 \pm 0.08\) and \(r < 10^{-4}\) (see `cosmological_models/`)
